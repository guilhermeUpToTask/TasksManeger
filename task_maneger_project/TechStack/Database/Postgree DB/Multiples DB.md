Nginx can be used in a proxy-based failover setup, especially in conjunction with PgBouncer (or similar connection poolers) for PostgreSQL. And yes, all of this can run within a VM. Here's how it works and the benefits:

**How Nginx and PgBouncer Work Together for Failover:**

1. **PostgreSQL Instances:** You have multiple PostgreSQL instances: a primary (for writes) and one or more replicas (for reads or as standbys).
    
2. **PgBouncer:** PgBouncer acts as a connection pooler _and_ a proxy in front of your PostgreSQL instances. Your application connects to PgBouncer.  
    
3. **Nginx:** Nginx acts as a _higher-level_ proxy, sitting in front of PgBouncer. Your application (or other services) connect to Nginx.
    
4. **Failover:**
    
    - PgBouncer monitors the health of the PostgreSQL instances. If the primary fails, PgBouncer can be configured to automatically switch connections to a replica.  
        
    - Nginx can also be configured to monitor the health of PgBouncer. If PgBouncer becomes unavailable, Nginx can be configured to redirect traffic to a backup PgBouncer instance (if you have one).

**Why Use This Combination?**

- **Connection Pooling (PgBouncer):** PgBouncer efficiently manages connections to your PostgreSQL instances, reducing connection overhead and improving performance. This is especially important for applications that create many short-lived connections.  
    
- **Transparent Failover (PgBouncer):** PgBouncer handles the switching of connections to a replica when the primary fails, making the failover process transparent to your application. Your application doesn't need to be aware of the failover.
- **Load Balancing (Nginx):** Nginx can load balance traffic across multiple PgBouncer instances (if you have them), further improving performance and availability.
- **Higher-Level Failover (Nginx):** Nginx can provide an additional layer of failover. If a PgBouncer instance fails, Nginx can redirect traffic to a backup PgBouncer instance.
- **SSL Termination (Nginx):** Nginx can handle SSL/TLS termination, encrypting communication between your application and the proxy.  
    
- **Static File Serving (Nginx):** If you have a web application (like a React or Next.js app), Nginx can also serve static files, as we discussed previously.  
    

**VM Setup:**

All of these components (PostgreSQL instances, PgBouncer, and Nginx) can run within the same VM. However, for production environments, it's often recommended to separate the database servers onto different VMs or use a managed database service (DBaaS).
